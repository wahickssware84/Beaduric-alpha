# Security Policy
Since this project consists of a simple CLI-based game which manipulates some local files (indluded in the repo), the security concerns are minimal (no network, no sensitive data).

## Supported Versions
This project is currently under active development by the creator. Ergo, only the latest version (main branch) is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Even though this project is entirely CLI-based and contains no network features, some security issues (e.g. unexpected file handling, unsafe dependencies, or build process concerns) may still apply in unexpected contexts.

HOWEVER, if you do discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public issue**.
Instead, simply report it directly via GitHub's [security advisory system](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories).

All (valid) reports will be reviewed and, if necessary, patches will be released as soon as possible.
