# Project Description
Beaduric is a single-player CLI strategy game based in the British Isles during the early medieval period (600AD). To win the game, the player must carefully manage limited troops and resources in order to defeat enemy armies in simulated battles.

# Gameplay (How to Play)
// NOTHING TO SEE HERE YET

# Mechanics (How to Win)
The outcome of a given battle is initially calculated using Lanchester's square law (for ARCHERS) and Lanchester's linear law (for INFANTRY). While Lanchester's laws will invariably determine the initial rate of attrition, other factors, such as Morale and Environment, will also play a decisive role when calculating the final outcome of a given Battle.
