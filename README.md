# Project Description
Beaduric is a single-player, text-based strategy game based in the British Isles during the early medieval period (600AD). To win the game, the player must carefully manage limited troops and resources in order to defeat enemy armies in simulated battles.

# Mechanics (How to Win)
The outcome of a given battle is initially calculated using Lanchester's square law (for ARCHERS) and Lanchester's linear law (for INFANTRY). While Lanchester's laws will invariably determine the initial rate of attrition, other factors, such as Morale and Environment, will also play a decisive role when calculating the final outcome of a battle.

# Planned Features (todo)
// Generate real-time descriptions of the local environment upon engaging an enemy army (the player must know this information in order to adjust their tactics accordingly).

// Difficulty settings - Jarl (Easy), Thane (Normal), and King (Hard). On Jarl/Easy difficulty, all combat-related values & variables will be skewed slightly in the player's favor. On King/Hard difficulty, all affected variables will be skewed in the enemy's favor. On Thane/Normal difficulty, all such variables will remain unaffected (balanced). This setting also affects the size(s) of the enemy player's manpower pool.
